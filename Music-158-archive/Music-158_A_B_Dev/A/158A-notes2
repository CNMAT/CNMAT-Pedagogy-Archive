how much max is needed

what do we want to teach them?

computation with musical embeddedness
	everything is oriented towards a musical investigation 
		in such a way that musicians don't feel completely detached from what they know

bridge building to m158B
	instrument design
		situtated within a musical framework


*** fusing of art and engineering ***
	afforded by connective tools


o.io and max are connective tool
	connect different media spaces

we have history to look at to evaluate where were are
	- interaction is now much more possible
		are we all amatures now? or capible of greater expressivity
		- there is access


situational expansion

musical frame

internal synth
	- good example of how control spaces allows us to think about music in a different way than we would have otherwise
	- musical lesson is that the internal synth is not an imitation of traditional instrument functionality
	- the internal synth caputres many of the ideas of music theory
	- what does the instrument afford?

how much msp to teach?
