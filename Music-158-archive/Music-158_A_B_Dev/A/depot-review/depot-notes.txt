rama's depot review notes, in folder order:

for all patches: [o.route slash 0] doesn't work like OSC-route, we probably can take out all the [r OSC] objects in these patches, I think this is a problematic design.

x = no longer relevant

--

/deprecated
	about_expr: still interesting, but not as used as it used to be
	about_imovie: not needed (x)
	about_OSC-route: x
	change-sym: x
	clock_diagram: still interesting, but maybe outside our current pedagogy approach?
	cnmat.round: x
	/hex-fx
		these are all still interesting, but need to be updated (see audio_effects)
    init-to-list: x
    /jsChord: x (bach library replaces this)
    /jsMelody: x (bach library replaces this)
    /jsNotation: x (bach library replaces this)
    list-*: x (odot and zl)
    MS-stereo: x (andrew benson patch? not needed)
    on_arithmetic: x (we might want or already have something like this for odot)
    on_data-storage: tutors

/patchers
    /basic_DSP
        asym-tanh~: 
            cool, should have line~ options to smooth changes (clicks a little)
        envelope-follower~: 
            useful, but could use some improvement, for example use edge~
        only-positive~:
            interesting, missing a more expressive example
        slictor~:
            not needed, better to use matrix~
    /basic_programming:
        everything here should be redone in odot... the most tricky material is time I think
    /data_generation:
        for pedagogy everything needs a musical example, or cut
        also, same as above, everything here should be redone in o.expr
        ... euclidean distance diagram with patch cords is broken now that max has curved patch cables
    /data_storage:
        make odot examples, not teaching pattr
        ali-pattr: x
        ali-readwrite: x
        /data_recording:
            *** this is an important problem that needs to be figured out for odot ***
            enveloped-recorder~: kind of useful, but this patch is very overly complicated, why not use line~?
        most of the other patchers seem pretty outdated here
    /data_streams:
        to odot (already started for m148B, but needs more work)
    /data_transformation:
        BPF-line-scaler: see o.function examples
        /Calibrators:
            rcalib: maybe useful, but needs to be redone to be legible
            rzcalib: ditto
        durations-to-onsets: broken, nice for odot
        durations-to-rel: good for odot
        int2digitlist: x, interesting but missing musical example
        letter2numblist: x, interesting but missing musical example
        letter2number: x, interesting but missing musical example
        lisp2coll: x, not that useful
        onepole: good, we need more data filter examples for odot
        OSC-alias: bad idea, very stateful and confusing
        everything pattr: better to stick to OSC now that we have full bundles
        splitsymbol: odot examples
    /depot_support:
    /diffusion:
        amp+delay_rectangle: 
            bad sounding doppler, should use delay xFading instead
        multipan: interesting, almost spat model, not sure what to do with this
            *note: maybe we should impletment VBAP in o.expr? shouldn't be very hard since we have the source
        pan+amp~: okay, sure
        pancore( see multipan )
        panhandler~: broken
        quad_amp ... to odot
        recording_rect: x
        simple_square: ... to odot
    /display_and_notation: (mislabled folder?)
        key_lookup: seems broken
        mt_player: ? maybe this patch is used somewhere else
        waveform_draw: x, but maybe interesting to make jit.buffer~ examples
    /effects_audio:
        I think these will be useful for creating m158A examples, although a lot of it will need to be updated, and could use many improvements and more clarity in the programming style.

/source

Piecemaker:
	this is interesting, but way out of date.
	it could be useful to create an odot version of this.
