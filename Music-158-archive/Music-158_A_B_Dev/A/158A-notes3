control & signal

frequency, time, and event organization

msp:
	know what processes are and know how to control them
	basic signal primer


opening month

	2 weeks basic control
		events and time
	2 weeks basic signal
		frequency and spectrum

	logistics of working with the program workspace

themes:

* spatial?
	for the course: headphone space

* onset
	how are we handling attack?
	attack as temporal event



simple synthsis modules
	cycle~ wrapped
		including amplitude envelope

continuous frequency vs. discrete frequency
note events

design names to never be mistaken
have a spec 

harmonics~
sinusoids~
	larger models

oscillators~

decaying-siunusoids~
resonators~


ways to create states and ways to interpolate between states
interpolate simple - complex
computational approaches for musical concerns


start with impulse decay space
then move to interpolated frame sequence

glissandi from event

monophonic
	bird synthesizer
		roughness
		spatial
		individual processes on each 
	singing voice example
		for adrian to contribute


pitch space
	probablistic models
	"don't do here what you can do on your piano"

	harmonic shifting space to spectrum space

proliferation vs polyphony
	frequency space
	interpolation
	distribution

continous sound instrument
	flute with theremin
	singing voice example (endless voice) 

teaching about patterns of computation and musical application

aspects for adrian to contribute

impulse and resonance
	impulse =/~ noise
	showing relationship and noise

	noise is perceived as all 
	pink~, brown~, white~
