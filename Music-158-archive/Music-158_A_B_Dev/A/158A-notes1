	timbre

creating melodies
	discrete note events with start middle and end


counterpoint
	time coordinations
	musical texture
	layers
		monophony
		heterophony
		polyphony


the course should constantly show that by taking a small thing becoming a complex thing that you can quickly generate rich or powerful sound

fundamental:
through simple manipulation, you can use computers to create complex interactions

Migrator is a good example
	probability based interpolation between lists
