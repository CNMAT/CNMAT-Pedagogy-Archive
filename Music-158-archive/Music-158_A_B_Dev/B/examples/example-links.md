As we move forward on 158B, please keep in mind that we need to create the platform for others to come in and teach the course in future.   That is crucial to grant and the project.  We need to keep all documents/teaching modules and references up to date.

One thing that is needed is a link space that will link to the "best of" projects and practitioners.  The new CNMAT site would eventually house, but for now we need a semi-permanent home that can be maintained.

I am thinking of people like Jean-Francois LaPorte.  It might be great to invite him in on SKYPE to demonstrate his many instruments and talk about his process. 

Scott Cazan did nice presentation that I videotaped at CNMAT. I will be storing things like that in our SPA-CNMAT account

I want to underline that we focus on artistic outcomes -- people who are achieving something as compelling artistic outcomes.
