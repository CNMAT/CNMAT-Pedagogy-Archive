give ursula a schematic for what needs to be soldered 

without high-pass:
- DAEX32Q-4 is much louder than DAEX32QMB-4 below 200hz


Tested DAEX32QMB-4 with first order 150uF capacitor, against another DAEX32QMB-4 without the capacitor, results:
- noticeable filtering of frequencies below ca. 300z (at 300hz the filter seems to not have a noticeable effect).
