# Music 158B / 258B
### Situated Instrument Design for Musical Expression
## Course Syllabus Spring 2017

* T/Th 09:30am - 12:30pm (lecture and lab)
* Dr. Rama Gottfried
* [rama.gottfried@berkeley.edu](rama.gottfried@berkeley.edu)

### Course Description

The practice and theory of contextual instrument design for use in musical expression is explored. Students create new instruments and performance environments using a variety of physical interaction paradigms, programming practices, and musical processes emerging from the UC Berkeley, Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT). Building on methodologies established in Music 158A/258A, the course develops aesthetic, analytic and technical skills through discussion, empirical study, and collaborative engagement. With a balance of artistic and technical concerns, participants deepen understanding of the creative process, demonstrating the results through class installation and public performance. Course can be repeated for credit. Prerequisite: Music 158A, 258A or consent of instructor.

#### Weekly Lab and Homework Assignments.

Each week students are assigned a specific paradigm of instrument design to be worked through in groups. Students individually prepare design sketches to be shared and tested with their teammates. Concluding each week is a critique session with the full class, where each group presents their lab work, shares their evaluation, and discusses ideas for future developments.

### Final Project Presentations

Music 158B/258B students do not take a standardized final exam. In lieu of a standardized final exam, students work in groups to create final projects applying the skills and techniques developed in class. Final projects will be submitted as video documentation and technical materials by the scheduled exam date, and will be presented to the public at a class performance-installation.

Music 258B students will be required to create a final project that is appropriate to the graduate level of study in music composition. The specifics of this requirement will be discussed and agreed upon by the instructor in consultation with each individual student. Graduate students from outside the Music Department can opt to take Music 158B instead of Music 258B, but graduate students in the
Department of Music must take Music 258B.

Office Hours:  Instructor is available for weekly office hours


### Class Materials

Music 158B/258B will use the Cycling’74 MaxMSP programming environment extensively. Students must have access to a laptop computer with MaxMSP, please see the instructor for computer access options. Students may choose to purchase a full copy of Max, or there is a Max subscription for the semester from Cycling '74, who offer a student price of $10 a month. For more information see the Cycling '74 [website](https://auth.cycling74.com/purchase).

Lab materials, including software, tangible user interfaces, sensors, actuators, will be made available to students by the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies throughout the semester. Lab materials are not available for home use. Students will learn techniques for prototyping instrument design away from the lab.

We will be making an extensive use of CNMAT's set of Max Externals. The required Max Packages for the course can be downloaded at the links below:
* [CNMAT-M158](https://berkeley.box.com/s/z6sbmrs2tplxy4bze15v4wgpszswmjdd)
* [CNMAT-Externals](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-odot/releases/tag/v1.0.9rc9-mmjss2015)
* [odot](https://github.com/CNMAT/CNMAT-odot/releases/tag/v1.0.9rc9-mmjss2015)

To install these packages on your personal computer, download and unzip the .zip files, and place the folders in the `~/Documents/Max 7/Packages` folder on Mac, `/Users/<myuser>/My Documents/Max 7/Packages` on Windows.

**Note for Windows users:** Currently the odot library is only 32bit on Windows. Please make sure to use the 32bit version of Max (even when running on a 64bit operating system).

#### Grading

Graded assignments have the following weight:

**Graded Work**   | **%-Value**
:--------------:  | :---------:
*Final Project*   | 30%
*Midterm Project* | 20%
*Lab Assignments* | 15%
*Group Engagement* | 15%
*Critique Engagement* | 20%

The grade distribution is:

*Percent*   | *Grade*
:--------:  | :-----:
100% -- 90% | A
89% -- 89%  | B
79% -- 70%  | C
69% -- 60%  | D
59% -- 0%   | F

Plusses are awarded for the top three percent and minuses are reserved for the bottom three percent of each grade distribution above. Opportunities for extra-credit will be announced during class hours.

**Midterm** and **final projects**  will be graded in terms of their synthesis and personalized approach to ideas and techniques discussed in the course. Instrument projects should demonstrate thoughtful attention to detail in the experience of the performer, the listener/viewer, and context surrounding the performance.

**Lab assignments** are structured as group activities where each student is assessed independently according to their work contribution and engagement in group collaboration.

At the conclusion of each lab assignment there will be a **critique** session in which the lab groups present their work to the other groups, and self-evaluate their approaches to the lab summarizing the things that they felt worked and things that could be improved. Engagement in the critique discussion is mandatory for all students.

#### Attendance

Attendance is required for every class without exception. Unexcused absences will effect lab and critique grades.

#### Academic Integrity

**Copying all or part of another person's work, or using reference material not specifically allowed, are forms of cheating and will not be tolerated.**

Specifically:
* Any work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this course from this instructor.

#### Accommodation

If you have been issued a letter of accommodation from the Disabled Students Program (DSP), please see me as soon as possible to work out the necessary arrangements. If you need an accommodation and have not yet seen a Disability Specialist at the DSP, please do so as soon as possible.

If you would need any assistance in the event of an emergency evacuation of the building, the DSP recommends that you make a plan for this in advance. (Contact the DSP access specialist at 510-643-6456.)

#### Discussion

We welcome all pertinent discussion and are counting on your participation in the course. We ask that your rhetoric deals with statements and ideas rather than with speakers and persons. Verbal attacks towards your peers will not be tolerated.

#### EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

**Tolman Hall Designated Waiting Area:**
Ground floor on the west wing has a designated waiting area adjacent to the north stairwell. First floor should be exited via the breezeway entrance. Floors two through four, have waiting areas located on the west wing at each of the two stairwells. Floor five has a waiting area in each wing located adjacent to the stairwells.

**Take note of emergency procedures posted in the seminar room.** If the fire alarm is sounding, exit the building immediately. In the event of an earthquake, duck when possible and hold in place. If you cannot get under furniture, cover your head with your arms, a binder or your laptop. Then exit the building when the shaking stops.

If you are in a wheelchair on an upper floor, proceed to the Designated Waiting Area near the elevator for evacuation. A Disabled Evacuation Chair is located in the first floor near the stairwell.

If you are in a wheelchair and in the basement area, exit through the emergency exit doors on the south and west walls. You may need assistance to get out these doors.
