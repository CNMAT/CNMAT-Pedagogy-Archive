make case for adrian on transducer issue 

*** stackable plastic bins
mail cases, clear ones
packing material

** mount esplora

*** microphone input possibly a better input than esplora?

	should we be using mics in m158A?
*** maybe combination mic/closed ear headphone system


VR, oculus?

compositional instruments

graduate students, maybe we need more readings?

what are the directions that we are helping the grad students go to?
	1) hybridized composition space
		modules to be used in multiple pieces as a platform

	

m158A module for creating wrappers

list of "skills" that are developed through the class
	

what are the goals?

prepare for 158B
prepare for their future work


computational and musical problem solving

	odot wrappers for interaction
	sound engines
	
	mapping and mixing?

	event engines
		continuous and discrete time
		automation, create views of this material

	expandable models of control, algorithmic ideas
		a way of thinking about scale, how small things can become big things
		how a small idea can generate complexity
			- probability distributions

possibility some students could come work at CNMAT for their final project


giving the understanding that by studying computation you are empowered

** to do organize m158A notes and put them in the dev folder

*** module framework ***
	which will allow future teachers grab units
	what does the module acheive
		musical and coding skills

translation of legacy depot materials to the new m158A framework
	creation of referencing document

high power examples:
	strong musical and computational examples
