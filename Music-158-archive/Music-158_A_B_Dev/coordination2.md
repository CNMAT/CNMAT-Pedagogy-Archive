DOCUMENTATIONS

make notes of what kinds of questions are coming up
assumptions that we bring to such a space
the state of the physical objects lul us into an illusion that we know what we're doing.

intending vs babbling

intension based on the situation

it's in the combination of things that you see the potential
    it's not just the collection of separated parts
    it's multidimensional, and then the potential for expressivity 

make notes of ideas
teaching syllabus

SPA CNMAT
    ask richard for access


question of time, with sensor input, time is not always now!
we can dialate time with digtial expansions of instruments
instruments can be used to navigate through an exsisting space

*repetoire*
    what still works beyond it's time?
    how does the definition of instrument change as the tools?

don't take the act of doing for granted
rethink from the ground up

    if not, what are we doing?
