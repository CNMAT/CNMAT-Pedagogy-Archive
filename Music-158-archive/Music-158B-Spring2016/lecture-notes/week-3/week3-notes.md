what do we mean by output?

sound:
    sound pressure
    speaker coils
    coupled vibration and resonance (stringed instrument)
    transducers
    basic room acoustics
    source radiation 
    digital signal processing







        Lab A: 
Presentation of output device kits: 
- Embodied: transducers, localized speakers, mechatronic
- Disembodied: surround sound, headphones
- Hybrid: electromechanical, transducers on instruments, real-time processing

    B   Lab B: 
Guided experimentation in groups on output device kits.

Discussion / Critique:
How do these output devices relate to the performance experience? How well does the range of values relate to the gesture of output? How do the names of output processes change the way we think about them?
