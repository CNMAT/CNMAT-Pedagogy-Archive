Intro III: Data Mediation

data mediation "completes" the picture of the instrument system
odot as mediator/translator of different data languages

spark instrument example
    show functions
    let students try it
    give out patch


what are aspects of agency in the instrument?
    who controls the pitches?

"composed instruments" as limitation and situation of possible results

embedded knowledge
    
digital dynamism, 
music theory, 
state constraints, 
scores, 
convention, 
stochastic design.

Lab A: 
Presentation of data mediation software kits:
- Preset Mangament (odot, Max for Live, SVG score)
- GDIF structure ?
- Mapping 
- Analysis

    B   Lab B: 
Guided experimentation in groups on data mediation software kits.

Discussion / Critique:
How do these data mediation paradigms relate to the performance experience? How well does the range of sensor values relate to values expected by the output devices?  What kind of knowledge is embedded in the data mediation process? Is data mediation itself an instrument?
