continuing from last week:
we learn to use tools, and adapt our bodies to use them
at the same time tools are designed to be used, and to be used in certain ways


what are the parameters of movement?
last week we looked at the tabla and flute player's movements 
how are they relating to their instruments?
    - two hands
    - their instrument is a set of possibilites

ideas of movement in dance:

dance is interesting to look at for us because it is movement "separated from instrument", of course you could also say that the space is their instrument, but it works differently because the space of movement in dance is arguably more open than the space of instrumental technique since tradictional muscical instruments require activation, and change of position to change the pitch of the instrument.

william forsythe's instructional videos are interseting in that he gives us some insight into how he creates spatial systems that he uses to interact. he calls it "improvisation technologies"
