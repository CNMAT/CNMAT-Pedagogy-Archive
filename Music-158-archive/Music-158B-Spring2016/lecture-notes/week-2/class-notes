Wacom 
	- has a pen
	- pressure sensitivity of fingers could be better
		- but pressure capabilities of the pen are quite good
	- data seemed easy to interpret, seems more stable
	- good tracking of fingers
	- has a particular texture, tactile feel

Camera
	- too irratic, seemed difficult to work with continutity between frames
		- data is changing constantly, difficult to study
	- lighting required an additional layer to the complexity
	- frame delta seems effective
	- the blob tracking is problematic
	- motion detection is cool!
	- the stable environment for blobs is more "a problem"

BCF2000
	- familiar object, a mixer
	- challenge: how are you going to use it in a different way than just using it to manipulate a track or EQ?
	- good way to visualize the data, it's right in front of you and physical
	- the thing itself makes sound!
	- discrete
	- doesn't jump around
	- buttons are cool
	- you can get -1 from the slider on the display
	- knob values are clipped 0-127 but the knobs phyiscally move continuously

	foot controller coming soon!

Lemur
	- smooth glass
	- wireless, more mobile
		- possible interferences
	- was unable to send OSC to two computers at the same time
	- is it possible to use the wired connection?
	- has visible feedback!
	- does the lemur give accerorometer data? light sensing? microphone?	

contact microphone
	- tests with table, need to access different pitches and notes, frequency ranges
	- midi notes were detected
	- put it on a water bottle 
	- good for isolating the signal and avoid crosstalk
	- good for amplifiying small sounds
	- contact mic seems noisy looking at the spectroscope, maybe good for percussive sounds
	- techniques for sensing needs to be developed
	- tape or adhesive
	- might require processing to make interesting sounds
	- it's analog, has the potential to be very immediate

Esplora
	- has a lot of sensors
	- but it's a game controller
	- theatrical
	- generation kill

(Breath Controller)


Lab: setup contact mics with new audio interface/mixers, experiment with sounds that come in, then try using the contact mic to control something
