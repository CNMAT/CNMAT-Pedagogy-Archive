for next time:
- give them a simple sinewave and amplitude to test the values

the sound engine itself gives the affordance to performance

why is the theremin better?
expressivity, vibrato, and spatial

test spaces
	** continuous vs discrete control **
        *** and time ***
	how is the interface at doing these different types of things?

mixers are proven instruments
multitouch etc. prove to be challenging
sound engines in depot:
    - plucked string, "1_string" in depot
    - "f0" m29 patch (additive synth, "keymouse synthesizer"
    - harmonisity vs inharmonmisity
    - fm
        pressure as inharmonisity 
    - granular space

** limited number of parameters **
    this is an excersise also: how to map the values for the sound engines
        difference of working in the high frequency range vs. low hz,
            they feel different!

connecting of sound thinking to known frameworks of musically handling these ideas:
    frequency spaces should be considered in terms of harmony
    if they are thinking in terms of sweeping sounds, this relates more to acousmatic approaches


what is the purpose of the instrument?
    - instruments are not just for performance, they can uses for developing sound
    - compositional (research)

bcf exercise:
    - use button for storing presets
    - use sliders for adjusting parameters for sound engine

the studio as a development work space


- maybe get some cheap reliable condensor mics for the class
    + sm58
