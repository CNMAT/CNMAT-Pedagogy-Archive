Feedback loops:
	with contact mics and transducers

what is feedback?


best?
	attach contact mic and transducer to resonant surfaces

rattle depending on stability of surface/object

diversity of sound based on surface

resonant frequency dependent on where you place the transducer on the material

high frequencies more responsive and feeding back faster

surprised that transducer doesn’t respond well on every surface

trouble controlling feedback because it was unmounted

resonators
	bass response is limited

other material ideas

outside sounds, air mics

location location location!

	window edge vs center
	piano
		has to be on the sound board

bass response is GOOD
	could be used for sub-audible


transducer + mic lends itself to live setting
	could be useful for installation
**	lack of repeatability using the microphone + resonators **

	responsive in realtime
	less polished?
	artistically dangerous?
	flirting with failure?

Repeatability?

french horn cracked notes, an old instrument, still has stability issues

quality questions
	use filters

cardboard filtered sounds amazing but if not… sounds less good
	you can do a lot with just filtering
	** ANYTHING CAN SOUND INTERESTING **
		(if you spend the time to make it sound good)	

bottle resonances were difficult to find

microphones 

glass resonance?
	because it has a wooden top

transducer on ukulele 
	
feedback on cardboard
	you could feel the feedback
	felt like a job wheel
	you really knew when you were going to activate the cardboard
	EQ had a large effect on the frequency reaction
