week    1   Intro I: Input Devices

Lecture:
    Overview input interaction paradigms, places, models, and natures. Performance gestures in music, dance, film, and puppetry. Instrument Design Model. Sensing the environment.

what is instrument design?
- people's intimate relationship with their instruments
    + calluses
        * guitar workout thing (springs)
    + oboe players building their own reeds
    + schmann multiliating his hands, liszt's techniques

- tools of today:
    - sensors, speakers, motors, etc.
    - how do we use these things to make music?

we learn to use tools, and adapt our bodies to use them
at the same time tools are designed to be used, and to be used in certain ways




    B   Lab B:
Guided experimentation in groups on input device kits.


Discussion / Critique:
How do these input devices relate to movement? How well does the range of values relate to the gesture of input? How do the names of sensor values change the way we think about them?
